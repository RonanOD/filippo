This application uses augmented reality to make it easier for people to draw a picture. All you need is a computer, a webcam and a printed _marker_. You place the marker at the corner of the canvas or paper you want to draw on, upload the picture you want to draw, then look _through_ the webcam using the transparent picture as a guide to drawing.
The name Filippo comes from Filippo Brunellschi who designed the dome of Florence's famous cathedral. It was Brunellschi who invented linear perspective using a mirror and a painted panel. This project is made possible using the excellent [NyARToolkit](http://nyatla.jp/nyartoolkit/) augmented reality Java toolkit. This was built, in turn, using Sun's Java Media Framework and Java 3D. If you find this utility useful please let me know!
