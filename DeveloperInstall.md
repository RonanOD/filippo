# Introduction #
This page describes how to set up a developer environment to install [filippo](Summary.md).


# Details #
Ensure you have the following installed:
  1. [Eclipse Java IDE](http://eclipse.org) and [the subversion plugin.](http://subclipse.tigris.org/)
  1. [Java3D](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/)
  1. [Java Media Framework](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/)
  1. [NyARToolkit](http://nyatla.jp/nyartoolkit/wiki/index.php?NyARToolkit%20for%20Java.en). This site is mostly in Japanese :-). Just download the latest Java bundle and import the main projects into eclipse.
  1. Use subclipse to import the main trunk into eclipse.
  1. Run the main filippo class.
  1. Adjust the classpaths of all projects to point to your versions of Java3D and JMF.
  1. You will need to have printed out the pdf with Hiro on it to see the AR effect.
