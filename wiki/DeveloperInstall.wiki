Ensure you have the following installed:

  # [http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/ Java3D]
  # [http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/ Java Media Framework]
  # [http://nyatla.jp/nyartoolkit/wiki/index.php?NyARToolkit%20for%20Java.en NyARToolkit]. This site is mostly in Japanese :-). Just download the latest Java bundle and import the main projects into eclipse.
  # Use subclipse to import the main trunk into eclipse.
  # Run the main filippo class.
  # Adjust the classpaths of all projects to point to your versions of Java3D and JMF.
  # You will need to have printed out the pdf with Hiro on it to see the AR effect.
