Filippo Drawing Application
===========================

This application uses augmented reality to make it easier for people to draw a
picture. All you need is a computer, a webcam and a printed marker. You place
the marker at the corner of the canvas or paper you want to draw on, point to
the picture you want to draw, then look through the webcam using the 
transparent picture as a guide to drawing. 

The name Filippo comes from Filippo Brunellschi who designed the dome of 
Florence's famous cathedral. It was Brunellschi who invented linear perspective
using a mirror and a painted panel. This project is made possible using the
excellent NyARToolkit augmented reality Java toolkit. This was built, in turn,
using Sun's Java Media Framework and Java 3D. 

If you find this utility useful please let me know!

This application requires:
 * A standard webcam.
 * A printout of the marker (tape or glue it to cardboard to make it easier to use).
 * The picture you want to draw in a JPEG image.
 * A place to draw near your computer so you can see the screen as you draw.

Have fun!
